        <p>My name is Leo Yada Karsb√¶k. I am currently studying to become a multimedia designer at Business Academy Aarhus. I like to play around with computers and get in-depth with technical problems that needs solving. I've always had a flair for maths and logic is one of my strengths.<br>
        Prior to my current study, I was studying to become an engineer in Information Technology at Aarhus University School of Engineering. For 3 semesters I was doing programming in Assembly, C, C++, VHDL and for other platforms suchs as PSoC and other development boards. I've since then switched to my current occupation, because I felt the need to express myself more visually than I was at my former line of study. <br>
